  <h2>Temporary Notice (October 8, 2025)</h2>
  <p>
    Our data backend has reached its traffic limits, so the interactive Weather Map is temporarily paused.
    I am currently optimizing query logic and caching to make the dataset more sustainable under load.

    Please check back on <strong>November 1, 2025</strong>. Thank you for your patience!

    <summary>Why is this happening?</summary>
    <p>
      The underlying API (used by the map tiles) exceeded the available quota. We’re reducing redundant
      requests, tightening server-side caching, and adding client-side deduplication to stretch the bandwidth.
